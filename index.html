How like a winter hath my absence been<br>
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!<br>
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!<br>
What old December's bareness everywhere! <br>
And yet this time removed was summer's time;<br>
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,<br>
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,<br>
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:<br>
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me<br>
But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;<br>
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,<br>
And, thou away, the very birds are mute:<br>
Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,<br>
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
